ABOUT UFO
=========

We decided to maintain font source files as [fontforge
Spline Font Databases](http://fontforge.org/sfdformat.html),
because that is, what we're working with
(and you can do, because fontforge is free software).

Anyway, we decided to also provide `.ufo` sources as
more general interchange format.

> The Unified Font Object (UFO) is a cross-platform, 
> cross-application, human readable, future proof format 
> for storing font data.
