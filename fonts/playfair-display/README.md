Playfair Display

CLASSIFICATION: serif


GENERAL INFORMATION
===================

Playfair is a transitional design. From the time of enlightenment in the late
18th century, the broad nibquills were replaced by pointed steel pens.
This influenced typographical letter­forms to become increasingly detached from
the written ones. Developments in printing technology, ink and paper making,
made it possible to print letter­forms of high contrast and delicate hairlines.
