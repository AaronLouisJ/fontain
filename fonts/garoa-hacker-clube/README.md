Garoa Hacker Clube
==================
CLASSIFICATION: Decorative


GENERAL INFORMATION
===================

Inspired by the 70's design, specially on Herb Lubalin's work,
the typeface Garoa is a rounded mechanical display font without
optical compensations, ideal for large bodies. The medium weight
has lower case for short texts, and the Bold versions have
singular upper case glyphs, with some alternates (at least one
alternate per letter â€“ some with OpenType features some using
caps on the keyboard).

The Garoa Hacker Clube Bold version is free and contains no
OpenType features, but the glyphs have the same design as on
Garoa Bold.
