Dancing Script
==============
CLASSIFICATION: Script

GENERAL INFORMATION
===================
Dancing Script is a lively casual script where the letters bounce and change size slightly.
Caps are big, and go below the baseline.
References popular scripts typefaces from the 50's.
It relates to Murray Hill (Emil Klumpp. 1956) in his weight distribution,
and to Mistral (Roger Excoffon. 1953) in his lively bouncing effect.

Use it when you want a friendly, informal and spontaneous look.
On any place where Arial and Times New Roman looks boring:
Invitations, Party Flyers, Happy Birthday Cards... you name it.
