LEKTON
======
CLASSIFICATION: Sans-Serif Monospaced


GENERAL INFORMATION
===================

The typeface has been originally designed at Isia Urbino by the students Luna Castroni, Stefano Faoro, Emilio Macchia, Elena Papassissa, Michela Povoleri, Tobias Seemiller, and the teacher Luciano Perondi (aka galacticus ineffabilis).

This typeface has been designed in 8 hours, and was inspired by some of the typefaces used on the Olivetti typewriters.

The glyphs are 'trispaced'. It means that the space are modular, 250, 500, 750, this allow a better spacing between characters, but allow also a vertical alignment similar to the one possible with a monospaced font.
We were thinking it was a bright new idea, but we discovered that was usual for Olivetti typewriters working with 'Margherita'.
