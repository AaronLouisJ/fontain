Kaushan Script
===============
CLASSIFICATION: Script

GENERAL INFORMATION
===================
Kaushan Script feels like writing quickly with an inked brush.
Use it when you want to energize your words!

When making digital typefaces, the more you refine the shapes of the letters,
the more energy you take away from them.
Because of that, Kaushan Script is unrefined - and carries a lot of energy.

By avoiding typographical sofistication, it stays more natural.
The angles of the vertical strokes varies and the baseline jumps around,
giving it a more rustic and natural feeling.
