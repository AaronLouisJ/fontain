INCONSOLATA
===========
CLASSIFICATION: Sans-Serif Monospaced


GENERAL INFORMATION
===================

> Inconsolata is an open source font created by Raph Levien and
> released under the SIL Open Font License. It is a humanist
> monospaced font designed for source code listing, terminal
> emulators, and similar uses. It was influenced by the proprietary
> Consolas monospaced font, designed by Lucas de Groot,
> the proportional Avenir and IBM's classic monospaced Letter Gothic.
> 
> There was originally no bold variant of Inconsolata, which caused
> less than optimal display on systems that used a bold variant to
> display text. However, when Inconsolata was added to Google Fonts,
> it was fully hinted and a bold variant was added.
