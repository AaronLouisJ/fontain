CODE NEW ROMAN
==============
CLASSIFICATION: Sans-Serif Monospaced


GENERAL INFORMATION
===================

Code New Roman is aimed for use in programming environments and
other circumstances where a mono spaced font is specified.
All characters have the same width, like old typewriters,
making it a good choice for personal and business correspondence.

This font improved and based on Mac OS Western New Roman,MONACO,
Windows Consolas/Lusida Consolas, ABeeZee and Bit stream Vera Sans Mono.
This font display allowed a design with proportions closer to normal text
than traditional mono spaced fonts like Courier. This allows for more
comfortably reading of extended text on screen. OpenType features include
hanging or lining numerals; slashed, dotted and normal zeros;
and alternative shapes for a number of lower case letters.
The look of text can be tuned to personal taste by varying the number of 
bars and waves.
